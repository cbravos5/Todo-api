# TODO API

## Objective

<br/>

The idea of this mini-project is to take the general todo projects to the next level, using modern features and tools.

With the increasing popularity of the API's, the key point here is to make a restful server that communicates with a front-end app.

This project counts with user sign, todos CRUD, a database for data persistence, token system for security and sessions maintenance, among other resources provided by external packages.

Due to the simplicity of the project, probably this is the final version of the API. The next step is to develop the front-end, keeping the main idea of using popular tools like react, vue, etc.
