# TODO API

## Objective

<br/>

The idea of this mini-project is to take the general todo projects to the next level, using modern features and tools.

With the increasing popularity of the API's, the key point here is to make a restful server that communicates with a front-end app.

<br/>

## Used Tools

<br/>

### Main Tools

- Nodejs
- TypeScript
- Docker
- Postgres

### Main Packages

- Express
- TypeORM
- JWT

<br/>
<br/>

## Future Work

<br/>

Due to the simplicity of the project, probably this is the final version of the API. The next step is to develop the front-end, keeping the main idea of using popular tools like react, vue, etc.
